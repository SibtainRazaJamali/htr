lines/a03/a03-027/a03-027-07.png|some 2,000 delegates , the biggest gathering since 1958

lines/a03/a03-030/a03-030-00.png|In some ways it will be a testing occasion
lines/a03/a03-030/a03-030-02.png|unassailable simply because there is no one

lines/a03/a03-030/a03-030-06.png|election . The rally comes at a time
lines/a03/a03-030/a03-030-07.png|when in spite of carefully worded state-
lines/a03/a03-030/a03-030-08.png|ments by the Prime Minister there is an
lines/a03/a03-030/a03-030-09.png|air of electoral expectancy .
lines/a03/a03-034/a03-034-00.png|Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on
lines/a03/a03-034/a03-034-01.png|a new Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks

lines/a03/a03-034/a03-034-04.png|a half years ago . Nevertheless there is little
lines/a03/a03-034/a03-034-05.png|illusion in the Conservative Party that their
lines/a03/a03-034/a03-034-06.png|stock at home has fallen in the face of
lines/a03/a03-034/a03-034-07.png|heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy .

lines/a03/a03-037/a03-037-03.png|fared badly . They are now faced with four other by-

lines/a03/a03-037/a03-037-05.png|one in Leeds , Ontario , and the other two in the

lines/a03/a03-040/a03-040-00.png|All four were Conservative strongholds . Last September
lines/a03/a03-040/a03-040-01.png|a public poll showed that for the first time since

lines/a03/a03-043/a03-043-00.png|However , a separate poll revealed that Mr.
lines/a03/a03-043/a03-043-01.png|Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of
lines/a03/a03-043/a03-043-02.png|popularity as an individual leader ( for

lines/a03/a03-043/a03-043-06.png|of Canada as a Prime Minister ? Many

lines/a03/a03-043/a03-043-08.png|seeking an answer .
lines/a03/a03-047/a03-047-00.png|It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson

lines/a03/a03-047/a03-047-04.png|impression remains that the Liberal leader

lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-00.png|MR. GAITSKELL today delivered a full-blooded
lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-01.png|defence of the Polaris missile base . And by
lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-02.png|implication he supported the establishment of
lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-03.png|sites in Britain for the training of German
lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-04.png|troops . His main theme was that nuclear
lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-05.png|weapons were necessary to defend Britain , that
lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-06.png|Britain must depend on Nato and  the West 
lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-07.png|must have nuclear weapons so long as the
lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-08.png|Soviet Union has them .
lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-00.png|Addressing the annual congress of the National Union
lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-01.png|of General and Municipal Workers , he said he felt
lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-02.png|sure the Labour movement was coming round in
lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-03.png|support of his views . Obviously conscious of the fierce and
lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-04.png|widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in
lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-05.png|Britain , Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that
lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-06.png|supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing
lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-07.png|their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on
lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-08.png|to the missile .
lines/a04/a04-050/a04-050-00.png|Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could
lines/a04/a04-050/a04-050-01.png|not deny facilities to nations to which it was
lines/a04/a04-050/a04-050-02.png|allied . But governments should be free to negotiate
lines/a04/a04-050/a04-050-03.png|and refuse proposals with which they did not
lines/a04/a04-050/a04-050-04.png|agree . The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles , because ,
lines/a04/a04-050/a04-050-05.png|he said , they were out of date and vulnerable and
lines/a04/a04-050/a04-050-06.png|would attract enemy action .
lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-00.png|That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine .
lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-01.png|So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons ,
lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-02.png|the West , somewhere , must have them too . It
lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-03.png|was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory
lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-04.png|purposes to be under the sea rather than on land .
lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-05.png|This was why the Labour Party did not think it right
lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-06.png|to oppose the Polaris depot ship .
lines/a04/a04-059/a04-059-00.png|The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base
lines/a04/a04-059/a04-059-01.png|in the Holy Loch , only 30 miles from Glasgow , a
lines/a04/a04-059/a04-059-02.png|city with two million people . It should be sited
lines/a04/a04-059/a04-059-03.png|in a more remote area . Mr. Gaitskell added that
lines/a04/a04-059/a04-059-04.png|the Scarborough conference decisions did not , in his
lines/a04/a04-059/a04-059-05.png|view , truly reflect the opinions of the majority
lines/a04/a04-059/a04-059-07.png|supporters in the country .
lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-00.png|Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the
lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-01.png|unilateralists was not possible , though
lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-02.png|he respected their views . He saw by reports
lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-04.png|recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear
lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-05.png|disarmament to shift the emphasis of
lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-06.png|their intervention away from straight opposition
lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-08.png|to the Polaris base .
lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-00.png|To Mr. Macmillan , Mr Gaitskell said the
lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-01.png|Prime Minister should begin to take
lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-02.png|seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear
lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-04.png|to Macmillan that he should press , I hope
lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-05.png|with the agreement of Kennedy , in
lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-06.png|talks with the Soviet Union , for the establishment
lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-07.png|in central Europe of a zone of controlled
lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-01.png|Union would be prepared to reach

lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-03.png|disarmament in Europe . Mr Gaitskell
lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-04.png|concluded , declaring that the present
lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-05.png|was the beginning of a great period of
lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-06.png|opportunity for the party . It was a
lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-07.png|great chance that should be grasped .

lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-01.png|Congress should therefore consider the
lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-02.png|matter . Consideration should also be given
lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-03.png|to the regrouping of unions and the
lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-04.png|modification of their structures to
lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-05.png|meet the growing concentration of
lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-06.png|capital . Mr. Cooper argued that a
lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-07.png|common industrial contribution was
lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-08.png|urgent - particularly in unions serving

lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-03.png|argued that the position needed examination .
lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-04.png|BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr.
lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-05.png|Macmillan yesterday morning he was given
lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-06.png|the views of a wide section of the
lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-07.png|British people about Polaris submarine
lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-08.png|bases in this country . An open letter
lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-09.png|written by Earl Russell hoping that the
lines/a04/a04-089/a04-089-00.png|Earl Russell , President of the Committee
lines/a04/a04-089/a04-089-01.png|of 100 , told Kennedy that he should
lines/a04/a04-089/a04-089-02.png|take notice of  that very large and
lines/a04/a04-089/a04-089-03.png|growing section which is opposed to
lines/a04/a04-089/a04-089-04.png|the establishment of a Polaris base ,
lines/a04/a04-089/a04-089-05.png|whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on
lines/a04/a04-089/a04-089-06.png|British territory .  He pointed out that
lines/a04/a04-089/a04-089-07.png|already there have been protests but
lines/a04/a04-089/a04-089-08.png|that  very much larger protests are to
lines/a04/a04-089/a04-089-09.png|be expected and are being planned . 
lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-00.png|There are three kinds of reasons that justify
lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-01.png|the protests and these should carry weight with
lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-02.png|the U.S. Government , Earl Russell suggested .  The
lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-03.png|first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-04.png|serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-05.png|U.S. and Great Britain , not only in Government
lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-06.png|circles , but in public opinion .  Earl Russell
lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-07.png|says it is inevitable , though profoundly
lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-08.png|regrettable , that the agitation against
lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-09.png|the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-10.png|to the policy of the United States .
lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-00.png|The second reason is concerned with doubts
lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-01.png|as to the safety of the people of Great Britain ;
lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-02.png| in the time of crisis it would probably be
lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-03.png|impossible for the British authorities to
lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-04.png|exercise any degree of control over the action
lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-05.png|of Polaris submarines .  He argues that
lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-06.png|there is a distinct possibility that so long
lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-07.png|as there is a Polaris base in Britain the
lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-08.png|Soviet Union might retaliate against
lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-09.png|Britain alone .
lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-00.png| Such retaliation might , and probably would ,
lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-01.png|destroy the whole population of Britain in
lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-03.png|provoking American retaliation . Earl Russell
lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-04.png|believes :  It is very questionable whether
lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-05.png|British membership of Nato and British
lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-06.png|permission of American bases on our territory
lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-07.png|add anything to the strength of America ,
lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-08.png|while , on the contrary , they impose upon
lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-09.png|America an onerous obligation which it
lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-10.png|may prove impossible to fulfil . 
lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-00.png|The third reason is that the supreme
lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-01.png|interest for the whole world - East and
lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-02.png|West and uncommitted nations - is the
lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-03.png|prevention of nuclear war .  A rapidly
lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-04.png|growing body of opinion in this country
lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-05.png|believes that Britain could be more effective
lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-06.png|in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral
lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-07.png|by helping to suggest agreements which could
lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-08.png|be accepted by both East and West . 
lines/a05/a05-000/a05-000-00.png|THE next White Paper on defence , to
lines/a05/a05-000/a05-000-01.png|be published in March , is likely to
lines/a05/a05-000/a05-000-02.png|contain a five-year plan for the three
lines/a05/a05-000/a05-000-03.png|Services . Its aim will be to produce superbly
lines/a05/a05-000/a05-000-04.png|equipped , all-Regular forces of
lines/a05/a05-000/a05-000-05.png|about 400,000 men . The three Services
lines/a05/a05-000/a05-000-06.png|would be  integrated  to a greater
lines/a05/a05-000/a05-000-07.png|extent than ever before .
lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-00.png|Short of wearing the same uniform , which is
lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-01.png|not contemplated , the Navy , Army and Royal
lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-02.png|Air Force would become , for practical purposes ,
lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-03.png|a single defence force . There would be
lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-04.png|complete co-operation at all levels in training
lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-05.png|and operations . This would apply also in the

lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-08.png|has been working on the plan for some months ,
lines/a05/a05-009/a05-009-00.png|He has had numerous meetings with the Service
lines/a05/a05-009/a05-009-01.png|Ministers . He has also had talks with the Earl

lines/a05/a05-009/a05-009-04.png|of defence policy . Details of the scheme
lines/a05/a05-009/a05-009-05.png|are now being worked out by the Chiefs
lines/a05/a05-009/a05-009-06.png|of Staff , a process that may take four
lines/a05/a05-009/a05-009-07.png|or five months .
lines/a05/a05-013/a05-013-01.png|approval . Mr. Watkinson remains con-
lines/a05/a05-013/a05-013-02.png|vinced that the policy initiated in
lines/a05/a05-013/a05-013-05.png|return to the tradition of all-Regular

lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-00.png|The Minister regards the recent trend
lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-01.png|of recruiting figures as encouraging .
lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-02.png|He is confident the aim can be achieved .
lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-03.png|While the possibility of an eventual return
lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-04.png|to National Service in some form
lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-05.png|cannot be entirely discounted , he does
lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-06.png|not agree that the point has been reached
lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-08.png|National Service is ever resorted to ,
lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-09.png|engagement would probably have to be for
lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-10.png|three years .
lines/a05/a05-022/a05-022-00.png|It is thought this would be the minimum
lines/a05/a05-022/a05-022-01.png|necessary for the extended training modern
lines/a05/a05-022/a05-022-02.png|arms require and to enable each man to
lines/a05/a05-022/a05-022-03.png|serve at least a year overseas . There is
lines/a05/a05-022/a05-022-04.png|no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson
lines/a05/a05-022/a05-022-05.png|is at odds with the Service chiefs over
lines/a05/a05-022/a05-022-06.png|the decision to dispense with National
lines/a05/a05-022/a05-022-07.png|Service , or over any other aspect of
lines/a05/a05-022/a05-022-08.png|defence policy .
lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-00.png|Criticisms about Army manpower appear
lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-01.png|to have come mainly from retired officers

lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-04.png|Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support
lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-05.png|from the C.I.G.S. , Field-Marshal Sir
lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-06.png|Francis Festing , who believes completely
lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-07.png|in the principle of an all-Regular army .
lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-08.png|Gen. Sir Richard Hull , who is to succeed
lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-09.png|Sir Francis , is equally convinced Mr.
lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-10.png|Watkinson is right .
lines/a05/a05-029/a05-029-00.png|Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard

lines/a05/a05-029/a05-029-03.png|Berlin crisis . Mr. Watkinson and his advisers
lines/a05/a05-029/a05-029-04.png|felt the change would be unwise at a

lines/a06/a06-044/a06-044-03.png|concluded :  The best service the Prime Minister can do
lines/a06/a06-044/a06-044-04.png|would be to resign .  The outburst shocked MPs of
lines/a06/a06-044/a06-044-05.png|all parties . Even close friends were signalling Mr. Fell
lines/a06/a06-044/a06-044-06.png|to stop .
lines/a06/a06-051/a06-051-00.png|There were loud cries of  shame  from
lines/a06/a06-051/a06-051-01.png|all parts of the Conservative side . Mr.
lines/a06/a06-051/a06-051-02.png|Fell appeared to be in tears as he sat
lines/a06/a06-051/a06-051-03.png|down . A few minutes later , Mr. Fell got up
lines/a06/a06-051/a06-051-04.png|and left the chamber . He returned five
lines/a06/a06-051/a06-051-05.png|minutes later to stand just inside the
lines/a06/a06-051/a06-051-06.png|doorway looking more composed . In the
lines/a06/a06-051/a06-051-07.png|middle of the amazing scene , Mr. Macmillan
lines/a06/a06-051/a06-051-08.png|waved his hand at Mr. Fell .
lines/a06/a06-057/a06-057-00.png|This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more .  I cannot be told
lines/a06/a06-057/a06-057-01.png|to sit down by the Prime Minister .  Protests had been expected
lines/a06/a06-057/a06-057-02.png|from Tory rebels . But Mr. Fell's attack was unprecedented . He
lines/a06/a06-057/a06-057-03.png|accused the Prime Minister of  political double talk .   It had
lines/a06/a06-057/a06-057-04.png|the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks this Prime
lines/a06/a06-057/a06-057-05.png|Minister is a national disaster ,  he said .
lines/a06/a06-064/a06-064-01.png|anything , rallied support to the Prime Minister .
lines/a06/a06-064/a06-064-02.png|This apparently , was Mr. Macmillan's assessment .
lines/a06/a06-064/a06-064-03.png|He confined his reply to the observation
lines/a06/a06-064/a06-064-04.png|that Mr. Fell had probably  maximised his
lines/a06/a06-064/a06-064-05.png|support .  There were no other attacks
lines/a06/a06-064/a06-064-06.png|of such ferocity . But there was ample
lines/a06/a06-064/a06-064-07.png|evidence of Conservative and Labour
lines/a06/a06-064/a06-064-08.png|opposition , which will be aired in the

lines/a06/a06-070/a06-070-01.png|House was crowded . He said :  No # British

lines/a06/a06-070/a06-070-07.png|long statement , Mr. Macmillan stated the
lines/a06/a06-070/a06-070-08.png|Government's intention :

lines/a06/a06-075/a06-075-04.png|for negotiations with a view to joining
lines/a06/a06-075/a06-075-05.png|the Community .  At this point , Mr. Paul
lines/a06/a06-075/a06-075-06.png|Williams ( Cons. , Sunderland ) called out
lines/a06/a06-075/a06-075-07.png| Shame .  Mr. Williams is a close
lines/a06/a06-075/a06-075-08.png|associate of Mr. Fell .
lines/a06/a06-090/a06-090-00.png|He claimed that , unless we were in the

lines/a06/a06-090/a06-090-05.png|raised by Tory critics . Mr. Anthony Fell ,
lines/a06/a06-090/a06-090-06.png|who created a scene on this point on
lines/a06/a06-090/a06-090-07.png|Monday , took up a position almost hidden
lines/a06/a06-090/a06-090-08.png|behind the Serjeant at Arms' chair .
lines/a06/a06-095/a06-095-00.png|Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help

lines/a06/a06-100/a06-100-00.png|Referring to previous negotiations , Mr. Macmillan looked towards
lines/a06/a06-100/a06-100-02.png|President of the Board of Trade played a conspicuous part ,  the
lines/a06/a06-100/a06-100-03.png|Premier said . He dismissed the idea that Britain would be
lines/a06/a06-100/a06-100-04.png|swamped by cheap labour . Our industry , he said , would
lines/a06/a06-100/a06-100-05.png|probably gain .  Many people feel we have had , perhaps , too

lines/d05/d05-040/d05-040-03.png|and so was the office of a bishop . Altars should be

lines/d06/d06-003/d06-003-01.png|by laughing at what are very real fears . As adults , we know

lines/d06/d06-003/d06-003-03.png|but to a child they are very real . Not that I am suggesting

lines/d06/d06-008/d06-008-00.png|To ridicule them only pushes them farther

lines/d06/d06-011/d06-011-09.png|which occur less frequently than

lines/d06/d06-030/d06-030-02.png|partly true . Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
lines/d06/d06-030/d06-030-03.png|amount of rest seems to make any difference . Sleep , to be

lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-01.png|only a disturbed tossing and turning
lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-02.png|which causes them to wake feeling worse
lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-03.png|than when they went to bed . We may begin
lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-04.png|to understand this a little better when we
lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-05.png|realize that tiredness itself is largely in
lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-06.png|the mind . Very few people , under normal
lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-07.png|conditions , work themselves to a standstill .
lines/d06/d06-041/d06-041-00.png|The mind tires first and conveys the impression
lines/d06/d06-041/d06-041-01.png|of tiredness to the body . This can be proved by

lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-00.png|Even more simply , test your own reactions
lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-01.png|to different situations . There are some which
lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-02.png|bring on an almost immediate feeling of
lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-03.png|tiredness - such as when your wife mentions

lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-06.png|veritable surge of energy . Many a girl who

lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-09.png|her boy friend calls and go for a long walk .
lines/d06/d06-050/d06-050-00.png|Nor is she necessarily being deceitful . She really did feel tired

lines/d06/d06-050/d06-050-03.png|with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion . A
lines/d06/d06-050/d06-050-04.png|disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
lines/d06/d06-050/d06-050-05.png|of fatigue . They wonder why they get no rest at night ,

lines/e06/e06-010/e06-010-04.png|echo-sounders . Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach

lines/f04/f04-004/f04-004-05.png|been his bride . There was little doubt of how
lines/f04/f04-004/f04-004-06.png|she had met her death , and even less that it
lines/f04/f04-004/f04-004-07.png|had been murder .
lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-00.png|She had been struck several times with a blunt
lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-01.png|instrument , and her head was smashed in .
lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-02.png|There were signs of a violent struggle , blood
lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-04.png|of her broken umbrella . But a pair of bone
lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-05.png|cuff-links found in the compartment seemed
lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-06.png|to provide the only possible clue to the killer .
lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-00.png|The body was examined , and it was definitely
lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-01.png|established that no sexual assault had taken place .
lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-02.png|It seemed probable that the motive had been
lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-03.png|robbery , and this was further confirmed when a
lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-04.png|check was made with the woman's relations in
lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-05.png|Hounslow . Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the
lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-06.png|Good Intent , a public-house in Walworth . Her day
lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-07.png|off was Thursday , and before coming up to London
lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-08.png|in the evening she had called on her two sisters ,
lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-09.png|one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the
lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-00.png|Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon ,
lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-02.png|she had tea with her other sister , and then
lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-03.png|went to catch the 7.42 . Her sister saw her
lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-04.png|to the station , helping her with some of
lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-05.png|her packages . This sister was able to establish
lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-06.png|that she had carried a green purse and
lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-07.png|had bought a railway ticket .
lines/f04/f04-020/f04-020-00.png|But both purse and ticket , and the packages , were gone when the body
lines/f04/f04-020/f04-020-01.png|was found at Waterloo . Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it
lines/f04/f04-020/f04-020-02.png|likely that she had been carrying much money . A porter at Hounslow
lines/f04/f04-020/f04-020-03.png|supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her
lines/f04/f04-020/f04-020-04.png|compartment when the train left , but this did not help much , since it
lines/f04/f04-020/f04-020-05.png|had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo .
lines/f04/f04-024/f04-024-00.png|The police began a systematic search of the line -
lines/f04/f04-024/f04-024-01.png|no easy task , but one in which patience and method

lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-08.png|overlook the possibility that this might have
lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-09.png|disguised another motive , and a thorough check
lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-01.png|me well meant , some mischievous , including one that a
lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-02.png|man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-03.png|the Thursday evening , with blood actually dripping from

lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-06.png|the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-07.png|in which she had died , there was nothing on
lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-09.png|adjourned .
lines/f04/f04-035/f04-035-00.png|Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
lines/f04/f04-035/f04-035-01.png|trails . It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
lines/f04/f04-035/f04-035-02.png|money to her relatives , and her brother-in-law was asked for
lines/f04/f04-035/f04-035-04.png|woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
lines/f04/f04-035/f04-035-05.png|named Brown .
lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-00.png|This man agreed that his engagement had
lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-02.png|tiff , but denied that he owed Miss Camp any
lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-03.png|money . All the while the police were casting about
lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-04.png|for a man who had been seen leaving the train
lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-05.png|at Wandsworth . A passenger described this individual
lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-07.png|a dark moustache , and wearing a frockcoat
lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-08.png|and a top-hat .
lines/f04/f04-043/f04-043-00.png|The porter at the station bore out this
lines/f04/f04-043/f04-043-02.png|Perhaps the news of their search got around ,
lines/f04/f04-043/f04-043-03.png|for a man did obligingly present himself

lines/f04/f04-046/f04-046-00.png|Even the bone cuff-links found beside the body , which
lines/f04/f04-046/f04-046-01.png|had at first been considered as belonging to the killer ,
lines/f04/f04-046/f04-046-02.png|proved yet another red herring , for it was learned that
lines/f04/f04-046/f04-046-03.png|they had been borrowed by Elizabeth Camp from one
lines/f04/f04-046/f04-046-04.png|of her sisters . A young man from Reading named Marshall
lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-00.png|This man was known to have left his home on February 11 , and
lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-01.png|to have been away for four days . Not in itself a crime , but , added to
lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-02.png|the knowledge that he had gone shopping in the town of Guil-
lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-03.png|dford for a false moustache , it left him with something to
lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-05.png|join the Army ( presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance
lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-06.png|his military bearing ) , and this was accepted .

lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-03.png|taxation not merely for defence and
lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-04.png|offence but for a very wide range of
lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-05.png|social services . A mediaeval oligarchy
lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-06.png|needed taxation in order to supplement
lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-07.png|the private wealth of the monarchy
lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-09.png|crown lands , the fees of feudalism
lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-00.png|Social service as a function of government
lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-01.png|was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its

lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-07.png|return was the uncertain bounty of booty
lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-08.png|and the vague advantages of military glory ;
lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-09.png|it was therefore always granted grudgingly
lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-10.png|and coupled with the vain hope that , in the

lines/g01/g01-034/g01-034-03.png|who usually supplied the hard cash , might
lines/g01/g01-034/g01-034-04.png|be bold enough to demand the production of

lines/g01/g01-039/g01-039-07.png|means of that ' staple ' system which ensured that

lines/g01/g01-039/g01-039-09.png|pervised and controlled , together with a
lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-00.png|There were two other sources of public revenue -
lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-01.png|first , the Church , which wisely followed the lead
lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-02.png|of the Commons and in its own Convocations
lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-04.png|the foreign merchants , with whom the King's
lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-05.png|officials had formerly made private bargains
lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-07.png|payments were now authorized by parliamentary
lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-08.png|sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-09.png|excess of the rate for native merchants .
lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-00.png|In addition to these revenues , the King had the
lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-01.png|financial benefits of his position at the head
lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-02.png|of the feudal system , as its chief landowner
lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-03.png|and the recipient of the fines of royal justice .
lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-04.png|It was , therefore , a complicated and not very
lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-05.png|satisfactory financial system in which the
lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-06.png|borders between private and public purse were

lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-00.png|But this time there was a very interesting
lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-01.png|attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-02.png|payments demanded . The definition of an
lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-03.png|adult was altered to read ' over sixteen ' ,
lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-04.png|and , where the poorest were to pay a groat ,
lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-05.png|the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-06.png|of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks ,
lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-07.png|and between these two extremes a graduated
lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-08.png|scale of payments was fixed for the
lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-09.png|different classes of laymen and clerics .
lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-00.png|Again the resentment was widespread and
lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-01.png|the results disappointing - a tax estimated
lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-02.png|to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000 .
lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-03.png|In the following year , 1380 , the last and
lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-04.png|most notorious third poll-tax was agreed
lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-05.png|by a Parliament which met at Northampton .
lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-06.png|There were dark reasons for a meeting so
lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-07.png|far away from the capital in a town with
lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-08.png|poor communications and not over supplied
lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-09.png|with hostelries and lodgings .
lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-00.png|London was again in turmoil ; but this time
lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-01.png|over a question of trade rivalry . A rich mer-
lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-02.png|chant from Genoa had been murdered , and
lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-03.png|John de Kyrkby , a Londoner , was one of
lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-04.png|those charged with the crime . It is clear
lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-05.png|from the chronicles that this was a sordid
lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-06.png|quarrel between monopolists and interlopers .
lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-07.png|The city merchants were jealous of foreign
lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-08.png|merchants who could tempt court and
lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-09.png|baronage with rarer luxuries than those
lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-00.png|A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure
lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-01.png|to mediaeval eyes . It was determined that 100,000
lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-02.png|was a fairer target , and the Parliament agreed to find
lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-03.png|two-thirds of this sum providing the clergy supplied
lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-04.png|the remainder . The method of assessment to which the
lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-05.png|Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax . The manifest
lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-06.png|injustice of this method had been to a certain degree
lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-07.png|corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax ,
lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-08.png|but this lesson was ignored , and the injustice trebled in
lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-09.png|weight by a flat-rate tax at treble the rate - every adult
lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-00.png|Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-04.png|The only concession made in view of the
lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-05.png|objections to the first two poll-taxes was
lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-06.png|the suggestion that the rich should help
lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-07.png|the poor - but this was only a pious hope
lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-08.png|because no machinery was provided for

lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-03.png|or in flagging warmer ones . At the time of its movement
lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-04.png|the heart becomes generally constricted , its walls thicken ,
lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-05.png|its ventricles decrease in volume and it expels its
lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-06.png|content of blood , appearing paler in so doing in animals
lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-07.png|such as serpents , frogs , and the like .
lines/g02/g02-062/g02-062-00.png|At one and the same time , therefore , occur the beat
lines/g02/g02-062/g02-062-01.png|of the apex , the thickening of the heart walls , and

lines/g02/g02-062/g02-062-05.png|the dissections of living animals , Harvey noted that
lines/g02/g02-062/g02-062-06.png|contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in
lines/g02/g02-062/g02-062-07.png|systole , simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries

lines/g03/g03-032/g03-032-06.png|evening , when George went to speak at Malin Bridge ,
lines/g03/g03-032/g03-032-07.png|they would be there to begin the meeting .
lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-00.png|As they became known the Choir went to working-
lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-04.png|day evenings to the Corner Pin Hotel , to rally
lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-05.png|the members . The B.S.P. also rented pleasant rooms
lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-06.png|on West Street , where a successful Sunday
lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-07.png|school was held .
lines/g03/g03-043/g03-043-00.png|One of the students was young
lines/g03/g03-043/g03-043-01.png|George , and another the dark-haired
lines/g03/g03-043/g03-043-03.png|George often spoke at the Sunday school .
lines/g03/g03-043/g03-043-04.png|He christened the babies . Also , when
lines/g03/g03-043/g03-043-06.png|at funerals . Religion was one of his pet
lines/g03/g03-043/g03-043-07.png|subjects , for being well acquainted
lines/g03/g03-043/g03-043-08.png|with the Bible , which he had
lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-00.png|Although his ideas were diametrically opposed
lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-01.png|to those of parsons he got on wonderfully well
lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-02.png|with them , particularly those who , like the Rev.
lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-04.png|the Church Socialist League , genuinely advocated
lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-05.png|socialism . With such men , who had the
lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-06.png|courage of their convictions and their
lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-07.png|Christianity , common ground could be found .
lines/g03/g03-052/g03-052-00.png|There was no abatement in political
lines/g03/g03-052/g03-052-01.png|work . The British Socialist Party endea-
lines/g03/g03-052/g03-052-03.png|Council , and to Parliament , being deter-
lines/g03/g03-052/g03-052-04.png|mined and obdurate in their attitude that
lines/g03/g03-052/g03-052-05.png|their candidate must go forward in the
lines/g03/g03-052/g03-052-06.png|elections . In the Sheffield Trades and Labour
lines/g03/g03-052/g03-052-07.png|Council meeting on October 16 , 1912 , George
lines/g03/g03-052/g03-052-08.png|had said , ' Mr. Barton would go to the poll .
lines/g03/g03-052/g03-052-09.png|Just as the Labour Party had fought the
lines/g03/g03-052/g03-052-10.png|Liberals , they were going to fight the Labour
lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-00.png|This new party , the British Socialist Party , was
lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-01.png|not prepared to accept the role of junior helper
lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-03.png|propaganda in order to increase the volume of
lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-04.png|socialist thought in the city , but sought to create
lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-05.png|in the Labour movement a more militant attitude
lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-06.png|capable of achieving socialism for the working
lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-07.png|people .
lines/g03/g03-064/g03-064-00.png|Alf Barton , who in 1911 was presented
lines/g03/g03-064/g03-064-01.png|with a book on the life of Marx ,
lines/g03/g03-064/g03-064-02.png|and a gold purse in recognition of his
lines/g03/g03-064/g03-064-03.png|work for the movement , was later
lines/g03/g03-064/g03-064-05.png|cessary to understand Marxism in order to

lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-01.png|a walk over the fields while we attended
lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-02.png|to our business . To my amusement ,
lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-03.png|when we met at tea at the rectory
lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-04.png|after the Dedication , the Archbishop
lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-05.png|said he had been stopped by
lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-06.png|a farmer in a field . He seemed
lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-07.png|rather indignant , but we took the
lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-08.png|episode without a smile till afterwards .
lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-00.png|The Hall proved most useful , especially in winter
lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-01.png|when the distance to the church deterred many from
lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-02.png|coming to Sunday Evensong . We managed to furnish
lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-03.png|a table with cross and candles , and the people
lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-04.png|appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well
lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-05.png|as for more secular purposes . In 1910 Dr. Talbot
lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-06.png|was translated to Winchester , and Dr. Hubert
lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-07.png|Burge became Bishop of Southwark .
lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-00.png|Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-01.png|work in connection with Higher Religious Education , and
lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-02.png|to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-03.png|Union . This meant organizing lectures and courses of
lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-04.png|religious instruction through the Diocese , and I
lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-05.png|also found myself a member of the Diocesan
lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-06.png|Conference , where I remember introducing myself as
lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-07.png|the incumbent of the highest church in the
lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-08.png|Diocese .
lines/g04/g04-014/g04-014-00.png|There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in
lines/g04/g04-014/g04-014-01.png|some quarters , until I explained that my church
lines/g04/g04-014/g04-014-02.png|was 800 feet high above the sea level ! The
lines/g04/g04-014/g04-014-03.png|work was growing pretty heavy , and we managed
lines/g04/g04-014/g04-014-04.png|to get a stipendiary layman who could help
lines/g04/g04-014/g04-014-05.png|among the children and young people .
lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-00.png|It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-01.png|in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play . The place and its people were
lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-02.png|to play an important part in my life . For five years in succession till
lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-03.png|war broke out in 1914 , I spent my summer holidays there and became
lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-04.png|very intimate with the people and the environs . Every year between the
lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-05.png|Passion Plays , an interval of ten years , another play would be
lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-06.png|performed at the small theatre in the village , when new talent would
lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-07.png|be discovered and trained .
lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-00.png|After the First World War , 1914 , I did not visit
lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-01.png|Germany for ten years , by which time in
lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-02.png|1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey .
lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-03.png|Towards the end of my five and a half years'
lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-04.png|incumbency I was asked if I would start
lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-05.png|a village choral society and conduct it .
lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-06.png|This opened up a new interest , and we plunged
lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-07.png|into it .
lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-00.png|First of all simple part-songs : I found only one member who had
lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-01.png|any idea of reading music . This was the village doctor who was an
lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-02.png|old school friend at Clifton . He could sustain the tenor part quite well
lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-03.png|and lead the others . As for basses and altos the conductor had to
lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-04.png|teach by singing the parts with them . It was very amusing , and by
lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-05.png|the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-06.png|could render simple part-singing tolerably well .
lines/g04/g04-032/g04-032-00.png|Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's ' Hiawatha's
lines/g04/g04-032/g04-032-01.png|Wedding Feast . ' Enthusiasm grew , and in a few more months we
lines/g04/g04-032/g04-032-02.png|gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster ,
lines/g04/g04-032/g04-032-03.png|and the tenor solo ' Onaway awake ' was sung by the Rector .
lines/g04/g04-032/g04-032-05.png|and we were all happy .
lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-00.png|IN 1913 Dr. Burge , Bishop of Southwark , asked me to go as
lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-03.png|who was to become a very intimate friend , and I was
lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-05.png|solicitor cousin . As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-06.png|ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield , we held
lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-07.png|great family consultations .
lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-00.png|My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-01.png|his family , and found a very suitable house nearby
lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-02.png|where my mother settled , and eventually died in 1926
lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-04.png|at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's .
lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-05.png|This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich ,
lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-07.png|a close friend of ours .
lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-00.png|But what a change from the dear little old church
lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-01.png|at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-02.png|at Purley . One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the
lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-04.png|had been a House of Prayer . I could not but feel the
lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-05.png|chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is .
lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-06.png|When we had found a group of people who gladly
lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-07.png|co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place
lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-08.png|of daily prayer .
lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-00.png|I suggested to the congregation that it needed
lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-01.png|warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we
lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-02.png|found many to help . Gifts of candlesticks and
lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-03.png|stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-04.png|helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-05.png|for prayer and quiet . In time we received similar
lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-07.png|windows .
lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-00.png|It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-01.png|such a beautiful building with suitable fittings ; I made
lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-03.png|the architect , himself a fine artist . It is quite possible
lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-04.png|to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-05.png|and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-06.png|table to the environs .
lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-00.png|We also had a little Mission Hall leading off
lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-01.png|the Brighton Road , in a street full of small houses .
lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-02.png|This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went
lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-03.png|there , but was soon changed into the better-
lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-05.png|were lots of children there , and we had
lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-06.png|a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-08.png|more help both at the church and Mission
lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-09.png|district .
lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-00.png|The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the
lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-01.png|Lansdowne Road district , but I needed more help in the
lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-02.png|church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays .
lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-04.png|1913 soon after I had come , and he organized the Mission
lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-05.png|district and got to know , and be known by , many of
lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-06.png|the people of the parish .
lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-00.png|A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following
lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-02.png|the Forces were urgently needed , and I felt clearly
lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-03.png|that one of us must volunteer . The Bishop , Dr. Burge , did
lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-04.png|not wish me to go then , as I had barely been in the parish
lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-07.png|was very soon in France where he did splendid
lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-08.png|work until his health broke down and he had a bad
lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-09.png|attack of enteric fever .
lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-00.png|Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-02.png|At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-05.png|wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation '
lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-07.png|in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-09.png|of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley .
lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-01.png|Purley , and from 1922 at Surbiton , I was continuously
lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-03.png|task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-04.png|the Committee . We had a splendid body of local residents ,
lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-06.png|Committee met once a week in the evenings , and
lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-07.png|included professional men from every walk of
lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-08.png|life .
lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-00.png|Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers
lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-01.png|were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen . Life was
lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-02.png|in those years more than busy . We now had a vicarage next
lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-03.png|to the church , and I was most fortunate in having for eight
lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-04.png|years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known
lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-05.png|well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the
lines/g04/g04-081/g04-081-00.png|On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to
lines/g04/g04-081/g04-081-01.png|Purley she offered to come and look after me . She was
lines/g04/g04-081/g04-081-02.png|a real treasure , of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic
lines/g04/g04-081/g04-081-03.png|things , a widow who knew how to look after the ' boy , '
lines/g04/g04-081/g04-081-04.png|who was the only other occupant of the house when
lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-00.png|We gathered together a splendid Sunday
lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-02.png|being given a number which , as they came into

lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-05.png|ster at her own home . Each child had a
lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-06.png|picture given them and the lesson was
lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-07.png|largely based on this . It was on a
lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-08.png|stamp which could be stuck in
lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-09.png|their book , and there was quite a

lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-00.png|It was quite amusing to see how much
lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-02.png|of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-08.png|it is a great joy to meet them now
lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-09.png|fifty years afterwards when so many

lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-01.png|me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-02.png|lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-03.png|continuing till old age to-day . When I went
lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-04.png|to St. Mark's , the first contact I made was

lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-08.png|of 1913 .
lines/g04/g04-098/g04-098-00.png|From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very
lines/g04/g04-098/g04-098-01.png|deep friendship which I have taken with me through

lines/g04/g04-101/g04-101-02.png|havens of rest , and the welcome has never

lines/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-02.png|affidavit to the effect that , whereas he
lines/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-03.png|had formerly been reluctant to approve the

lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-00.png|These , if she had only known it , were
lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-01.png|precisely the reasons why her cousin took
lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-02.png|pleasure in the opportunity of annoying her .
lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-03.png|Lady Byron did not like Augusta to have
lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-04.png|intimate friends , and in every instance where

lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-06.png|to find some excuse for bestowing , in whole

lines/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-00.png|George Anson Byron had seen enough of

lines/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-02.png|to be aware that Augusta , so far from

lines/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-04.png|marriage , had been Lady Byron's greatest
lines/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-05.png|support and comfort at the time ; but it
lines/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-06.png|had been deemed necessary all the

lines/h01/h01-000/h01-000-06.png|related to all women who were or had been
lines/h01/h01-000/h01-000-07.png|married , and so repeated the enquiry made

lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-00.png|We have held eleven meetings . We decided as a
lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-01.png|first step to seek information from a number
lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-02.png|of organisations and persons having an interest
lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-03.png|in the questions before us and at a later stage we
lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-04.png|arranged for publication of a press notice inviting
lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-05.png|anybody interested to submit representations . We
lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-06.png|compiled a list of the points which we thought
lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-07.png|were of importance , but we made it clear that
lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-08.png|the replies need not be confined to these
lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-09.png|particular items .
lines/h02/h02-008/h02-008-01.png|we found it an advantage in certain instances . Appendix
lines/h02/h02-008/h02-008-02.png|1 gives a list of the bodies and persons consulted . The
lines/h02/h02-008/h02-008-03.png|Department of Health for Scotland , the Home Office and
lines/h02/h02-008/h02-008-05.png|officers of these Departments attended our meetings
lines/h02/h02-008/h02-008-06.png|and have given us valuable assistance .
lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-02.png|which arose from our terms of reference and
lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-03.png|which had been brought specially to our notice .
lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-04.png|First , we were asked to examine the risks
lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-05.png|attending the abuse of carbromal and
lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-06.png|bromvaletone and preparations containing these
lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-07.png|substances . The Poisons Board had already
lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-08.png|considered this problem but , in the absence of
lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-09.png|sufficient evidence that these compounds
lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-00.png|4 . On examination of the evidence it became clear
lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-01.png|to us that carbromal and bromvaletone were examples
lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-02.png|of a number of drugs on sale to the public which
lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-03.png|were not appropriate for restriction to supply on

lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-05.png|or the Therapeutic Substances Act , 1956 , and had
lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-06.png|not so far been recommended for control as

lines/h02/h02-022/h02-022-07.png|grounds for restricting any of them also to supply

lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-03.png|course of their professional duties . We
lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-04.png|ascertained that the incidence of this irregular-
lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-05.png|ity was very small indeed . However , over a
lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-06.png|period of eleven years , patients' lives had been
lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-07.png|endangered in two known instances .
lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-00.png|We were assured by our expert witnesses on this
lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-01.png|subject that , with the apparatus at present to hand , the
lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-02.png|preliminary sniffing of the gases immediately before
lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-03.png|administering them to a patient was a recognised and
lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-04.png|necessary precaution . We accepted this . 10 . In view of
lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-05.png|the heavy and direct responsibility carried by every
lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-06.png|anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted
lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-07.png|to the inhalation of gases and vapours should never be
lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-08.png|entrusted with their administration .

lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-02.png|brought to the notice of the Home Office
lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-03.png|at that time in which exceptionally
lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-04.png|large quantities of morphine and heroin
lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-05.png|had been supplied to particular practi-

lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-03.png|noticed , had asked for Coca-Cola . This
lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-04.png|rather surprised me from a young man
lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-05.png|who was otherwise so sophisticated . He
lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-06.png|was not , however , ostentatious about
lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-07.png|the matter .
lines/k02/k02-023/k02-023-00.png|If anything , he had merely become a little more reserved , and
lines/k02/k02-023/k02-023-01.png|much more polite . I thought to myself : ' A few years in the

lines/k02/k02-029/k02-029-00.png|Lee , however , showed not the slightest sign of fatigue . ' I

lines/k02/k02-029/k02-029-05.png|gallantly , he said :

lines/k02/k02-053/k02-053-05.png|wrapped a 6sarong around my waist , if
lines/k02/k02-053/k02-053-06.png|Nigel at all resented being deprived of his
lines/k02/k02-053/k02-053-07.png|afternoon sleep .
lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-00.png|And I said to myself : Oh , God , doesn't the

lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-02.png|from me almost instantly , but it had
lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-03.png|been enough to make me conscious of the
lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-06.png|probably thought my appearance quite a breach
lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-07.png|of the social graces ; but , naturally , he said
lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-08.png|not so much as a word about it .

lines/k02/k02-076/k02-076-00.png|Perhaps Lee wasn't quite as

lines/k02/k02-093/k02-093-00.png|Knowing Nigel , I would have been surprised if he
lines/k02/k02-093/k02-093-01.png|had not made his usual ' arrangements ' . A bachelor
lines/k02/k02-093/k02-093-02.png|himself , he knew well how to entertain his bachelor
lines/k02/k02-093/k02-093-03.png|friends . He caught my look and pursed his lips in
lines/k02/k02-093/k02-093-04.png|a quick little grimace of acknowledgement ; then raised
lines/k02/k02-093/k02-093-05.png|an enquiring eyebrow in young Lee's direction .
lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-00.png|I shrugged a shoulder . Lee would have
lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-01.png|to decide about that for himself , I
lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-02.png|thought , and noticed that although he
lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-03.png|was looking at the other girl , he did
lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-04.png|so quite dispassionately , almost as though
lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-05.png|he was merely interested in the unfamiliar
lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-06.png|clothes she was wearing . And I thought
lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-07.png|to myself : He may be still too much of
lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-08.png|a ' new chum ' to see ' the beauty of
lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-09.png|the East ' .
lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-00.png|There was still an ease in our conversation , but its
lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-01.png|scope was restricted . I felt that I could hardly make the

lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-05.png|And I suppose he felt the same . We had only a few drinks ,
lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-06.png|then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early
lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-07.png|dinner .

lines/k04/k04-054/k04-054-09.png|of Diocletian .
lines/k04/k04-057/k04-057-00.png|Vittoria , accompanied by her maid , Lucia , was on her
lines/k04/k04-057/k04-057-04.png|debts . Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress
lines/k04/k04-057/k04-057-06.png|with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her
lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-00.png|The sparkling society of the Doria Palace , the flattery
lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-02.png|restless spirit , all threw into sharp relief the contrast
lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-03.png|of her grey life with the splendid one that filled
lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-06.png|to give her a separate establishment , he invariably
lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-07.png|pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle , who
lines/k04/k04-064/k04-064-00.png|He reminded her that they must abide by Roman
lines/k04/k04-064/k04-064-01.png|custom , and dwell there with their relations . Her
lines/k04/k04-064/k04-064-02.png|values were those of the materialist who assesses
lines/k04/k04-064/k04-064-03.png|every human being in terms of fame , power and
lines/k04/k04-064/k04-064-04.png|wealth . Francesco she despised for his dullness , his
lines/k04/k04-064/k04-064-05.png|lack of initiative , his subservience to his uncle .
lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-00.png|Her husband's gentleness and amiability , his unselfish
lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-01.png|love for her , she regarded as signs of weakness . He was a
lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-02.png|futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving
lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-03.png|her a child . Whatever passion she had experienced in the
lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-04.png|first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt .
lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-05.png|She had never loved him . Her thoughts rushed to Orsini .
lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-06.png|Since the meeting in the Doria Palace , no word had
lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-07.png|come from him , and this silence oppressed her spirits
lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-08.png|with a weight of misgiving .
lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-00.png|She had , perhaps , demanded too much . The
lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-01.png|kiss in the garden had plumbed unsus-
lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-02.png|pected depths in her , and she knew that
lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-04.png|indeed , match his . Every instinct urged her to
lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-06.png|to which her own had responded as it
lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-07.png|had responded to no other human being .
lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-00.png|Prudence , ambition and reason had
lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-01.png|held instinct in check , and they must
lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-03.png|compromise . For a brief interval
lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-04.png|she allowed herself the luxury of
lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-05.png|dreams . She began to imagine life at
lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-07.png|conversation of poets and dilettanti . She
lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-09.png|ment , and herself on the ducal dais beside
lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-10.png|Orsini , placing a chaplet of roses on the brows
lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-00.png|This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a
lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-02.png|the two girls from their seats . Lucia uttered a cry of
lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-03.png|alarm . ' Look , madonna , we are surrounded ! ' It was true .
lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-04.png|Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about
lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-07.png|shrieked Lucia . ' Banditti ! '
lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-00.png|Vittoria now realized that they were outside
lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-02.png|crouching in the doorway of the church and exhibiting
lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-04.png|Lucia , ' said Vittoria , pointing to the badge on the man's
lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-06.png|stared speechlessly at the golden bear ; Vittoria swiftly
lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-07.png|averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance
lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-00.png|Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic . The
lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-01.png|coach now turned in another direction , towards
lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-02.png|the wild and desolate region behind the baths .
lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-03.png|It was sparsely inhabited , dotted with fallow fields
lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-04.png|and terraced vineyards , and here and there jutted
lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-05.png|a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins , a pathetic
lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-06.png|reminder of Rome's former greatness .
lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-00.png|In this region of Monti most of the public baths
lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-01.png|had been built in the time of the Caesars , but with the
lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-02.png|breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions
lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-03.png|the baths had lost their purpose ; they had become
lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-06.png|used these quarries as hiding places , to the danger
lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-07.png|of travellers in the district .
lines/k04/k04-106/k04-106-00.png|As they lumbered past at a rattling pace , Vittoria
lines/k04/k04-106/k04-106-01.png|could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a
lines/k04/k04-106/k04-106-02.png|gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures
lines/k04/k04-106/k04-106-03.png|gathered about it , cooking their frugal meal . These
lines/k04/k04-106/k04-106-04.png|were left far behind . An old man belabouring an
lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-01.png|Lucia might have been the only living
lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-02.png|creatures on an empty planet . After the
lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-03.png|initial shock , Vittoria felt calm . She
lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-04.png|knew exactly what she wanted , and
lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-05.png|was prepared to take it without scruple ,
lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-06.png|if she could . What she had forgotten
lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-07.png|in her self-absorption in her own schemes
lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-08.png|was that other people were equally absorbed
lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-09.png|in their schemes , which were likely to
lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-00.png|This move today was a reminder of that fact .
lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-01.png|Whilst she automatically patted the hand of
lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-02.png|the agitated Lucia , her brain was working
lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-03.png|rapidly , and she decided that she must be
lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-05.png|difficult though that would be . She became
lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-06.png|aware that the pace was slackening ;
lines/k04/k04-119/k04-119-00.png|The moment had come . Upon the ensuing interview
lines/k04/k04-119/k04-119-02.png|her heart was beating fast , and the palms of her
lines/k04/k04-119/k04-119-03.png|hands were damp . Orsini's high-crowned hat with
lines/k04/k04-119/k04-119-04.png|its jaunty plume blotted out the light ; his hand
lines/k04/k04-126/k04-126-01.png|language : ' Yes . But make it worth her while . '
lines/k04/k04-126/k04-126-02.png|' I see . I know how to deal with people like that , '
lines/k04/k04-126/k04-126-03.png|and turning to the cowering Lucia , he spoke in her
lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-00.png|Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat .
lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-01.png|Thrusting his head farther into the coach , he said
lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-02.png|sombrely : ' Have you ever heard of a punishment called
lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-08.png|heard of it ?
lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-00.png|The Orsini give that to traitors . There is
lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-01.png|no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini . We hunt
lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-02.png|a traitor down to the ends of the earth , and no
lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-03.png|power can save him ... or her . Do you understand ? '
lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-05.png|continued , giving her a keen look , ' the Orsini are
lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-06.png|generous to those who serve them faithfully .
lines/k04/k04-149/k04-149-01.png|speech . He turned to Vittoria , sitting erect ,
lines/k04/k04-149/k04-149-02.png|with flushed cheeks and eyes sparkling with
lines/k04/k04-156/k04-156-05.png|be so good as to order your men not to molest my
lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-01.png|nevertheless , to the man who had peered into the
lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-02.png|coach , whom he had addressed as Luigi , and gave him sharp
lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-03.png|instructions on the matter . Vittoria stood looking about her ,
lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-04.png|breathing the scent of thyme . The land at her feet sloped
lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-05.png|away into a tiny valley beyond which , on the crest
lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-06.png|of a wooded hill-side , the ruins of a small temple
lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-07.png|were etched against the clear blue of the sky .
lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-00.png|He forgot time and place . He , the master , was gently
lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-01.png|led along erotic paths which he knew existed , but
lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-02.png|had never trodden . He learned how to use his
lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-03.png|hands , how to adore that body without haste , how
lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-04.png|to caress every inch with his mouth as well , to
lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-05.png|creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost
lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-06.png|himself in a rapture of kisses in places he 'd
lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-07.png|dreamed of , where life began to ooze and quickened
lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-08.png|his heart beat to a thunder .
lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-00.png|He looked at her . Head thrown back in a pool of hair ,
lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-01.png|her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her
lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-02.png|heart in the full throat . Her mouth did things he
lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-03.png|thought no human being could stand without
lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-04.png|dying , but he went on living in an ocean of
lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-05.png|voluptuousness , that swelled and ebbed over him ,
lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-06.png|under him , in him and through him ...
lines/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-00.png|He was having a ball ! He twiddled the TV set with
lines/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-01.png|shaking hands . She sat calmly on the bed smoking
lines/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-02.png|a cigarette . His face was white with two red
lines/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-04.png|Was that any better ? You know it was ! You don't
lines/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-05.png|need teaching , only a little coaxing .
lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-00.png|He sat down and ran his finger down along her
lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-01.png|spine . Do you love me now ? Like yesterday ! I 'm
lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-03.png|to satisfy my physical wants does not change that .
lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-04.png|Before long you 'll give me the satisfaction that 'll set
lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-05.png|me rocking on my feet , but I 'll still be only fond of
lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-06.png|you . But you wouldn't marry me ?
lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-00.png|No . I 'm not your type . I 'd make you miserable . I
lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-01.png|mean that . I 'd very probably be unfaithful and
lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-02.png|that 'd kill you . Then I 'd be unfaithful too , to teach
lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-04.png|spite me . I would never do it for that reason .
lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-05.png|To me it 'd be immaterial whether you 'd retaliate
lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-06.png|or not . You 'd go crazy if that situation arose .
lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-00.png|To observe the colour rise in her cheek
lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-01.png|and hear her breath come faster , to see
lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-02.png|the slight beads of sweat come out on
lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-03.png|her glistening skin and see her move
lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-04.png|with uncontrolled rhythm . To have her twist
lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-05.png|in an attempt to receive a caress he was
lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-06.png|purposely withholding , to hear her deep-throated
lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-07.png|moan of full satisfaction and feel her
lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-08.png|shivering , clawing surrender .
lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-00.png|Not so dusty , she might say afterwards , drawing at
lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-01.png|a cigarette . It 's a wow ! he said . She kissed
lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-02.png|him motherly : You just wait till you teach the
lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-03.png|girl you really love . He didn't protest any more
lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-04.png|to say he loved her because he knew it to
lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-05.png|be untrue . Instead he said : Will that be
lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-06.png|better ? She nodded :
lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-00.png|It 's man's nature to teach and to teach those
lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-01.png|we love is double pleasure . And she
lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-03.png|lights on . You lose half the fun when you
lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-04.png|fumble in the dark . She had many direct
lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-05.png|comments like that . Once she quietly
lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-06.png|pushed him back when he kissed her too
lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-07.png|fully and too soon :
lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-00.png|Oi , not yet , you oaf . What do you think my
lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-01.png|mouth is ? A billposter's bucket to be
lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-02.png|plunged in at random ? He 'd learned to
lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-03.png|laugh when something went wrong or the
lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-04.png|situation became ludicrous , as when they
lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-05.png|were both caught in the raw when he 'd
lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-06.png|forgotten to lock his door and Derek
lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-07.png|had walked in unexpectedly .
lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-00.png|They 'd just had time to nip into the
lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-01.png|bathroom and stood there shivering for
lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-02.png|fifteen minutes while their guest was
lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-03.png|smoking a cigarette waiting for him .
lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-04.png|At last Derek got tired and left .
lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-05.png|Just in time , erupted Charlie . If he 'd
lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-06.png|stayed any longer I 'd jolly well
lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-07.png|have asked him to join us . I 'm so
lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-08.png|darned cold I could do with two men .
lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-00.png|You perverted sex-maniac , you wouldn't
lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-01.png|dare . Show me what you can do and
lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-02.png|I 'll tell you if you need help .
lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-03.png|Once he came back to the subject
lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-04.png|of her marriage and asked her why
lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-05.png|she was going to marry her sculptor .
lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-06.png|Because I love him , of course .
lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-07.png|What do you think ?
lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-01.png|I suppose so . What attracts you ?
lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-02.png|It can't be physical ? Of course
lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-03.png|not ! I love him for what he is
lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-04.png|- he 's so great I 'm a bit scared
lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-05.png|of him - a woman must be a bit
lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-06.png|scared to be really in love .
lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-07.png|That 's why you could never

lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-00.png|Correct , ducky ! You just wait till

lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-03.png|You think that sculptor 's a god ?
lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-04.png|Perhaps , in a way . All I know is
lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-06.png|heart beat in her throat . But how
lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-07.png|about the physical side ? You 're
lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-08.png|quite an erotic little beast ; can

lines/l04/l04-062/l04-062-05.png|manner in which he had dispatched

lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-02.png|more on Kitty . If she was really in love with Stevie
lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-03.png|Hewitt it was madness to go on worrying about her , he
lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-04.png|told himself moodily . Yet it was not as clear-cut as that .
lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-05.png|He not only felt his need of her but was equally aware
lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-06.png|of the necessity to help and protect her , even against
lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-07.png|her will .
lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-00.png|Tonight , for the first time , he had abandoned all
lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-01.png|pretence and shown her the honest desperation of his feeling
lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-02.png|for her . She had neither encouraged nor completely rejected
lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-03.png|him . In some perverse way their brief quarrel had forged
lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-04.png|a bond between them . No doubt she had every intention
lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-05.png|of keeping both of them on a string . On the whole he probably
lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-06.png|had a slight advantage over the young man , inasmuch as he
lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-07.png|had money to spend and she was a girl who had a healthy
lines/l04/l04-082/l04-082-01.png|But he was still no sort of match for a young
lines/l04/l04-082/l04-082-02.png|and virile competitor and he knew it . He turned
lines/l04/l04-082/l04-082-03.png|away and begun to undress , shivering with the
lines/l04/l04-082/l04-082-04.png|cold . His eye automatically glanced towards the
lines/l04/l04-082/l04-082-05.png|panel which concealed the hiding-place of his
lines/l04/l04-082/l04-082-06.png|secret treasure . For an instant he stood
lines/l04/l04-082/l04-082-07.png|transfixed to the floor , his eyes unwavering
lines/l04/l04-082/l04-082-08.png|as they riveted themselves on the wall .
lines/l04/l04-087/l04-087-00.png|Was it his imagination or was the panel slightly lop-sided ?
lines/l04/l04-087/l04-087-01.png|Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong
lines/l04/l04-087/l04-087-02.png|panel and pulled it out . The black tin box was exactly
lines/l04/l04-087/l04-087-03.png|as he had left it . With heavily beating heart he reached
lines/l04/l04-087/l04-087-04.png|out and lifted the lid . Everything was intact and he
lines/l04/l04-087/l04-087-05.png|gasped with relief .
lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-00.png|He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor
lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-02.png|that fifty pounds for Kitty ! Obviously he had been careless in
lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-03.png|replacing the panel , but the possibility of anyone having
lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-04.png|discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a shock .
lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-06.png|box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the
lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-07.png|cupboard .

lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-01.png|Henry Mansell's face he saw , hovering
lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-02.png|above his head like a hideous caricature . The
lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-03.png|parrot nose and straight line of the mouth ,
lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-04.png|the pitiless blue eyes that seemed to strip

lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-06.png|bones . The mouldering horror that had

lines/l07/l07-131/l07-131-07.png|had their eyes on a seagoing boat .
lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-00.png|Clive - he insisted on being called Clive -
lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-01.png|haggled with him and within half an hour
lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-02.png|Sandpiper was mine for three hundred and
lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-03.png|fifty pounds . When all the business details
lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-04.png|had been settled and the owner had
lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-05.png|departed with my cheque in his pocket ,
lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-06.png|Clive started the engine and gave me my
lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-07.png|first lesson in manoeuvring up and down
lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-00.png|It was a warm , still evening ; the plop of
lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-01.png|fish and the gentle putter of the engine
lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-02.png|were infinitely soothing after city noises ,
lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-03.png|and I began to look forward to my life
lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-04.png|on the water . At last he pronounced
lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-05.png|me riverworthy and wanted to know when
lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-06.png|I would be moving in .
lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-00.png|Like Clive , he was enthusiastic about the
lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-01.png|engine and decided , apparently on the strength
lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-02.png|of its efficiency , that Sandpiper was fit to
lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-03.png|live in . I was more than thankful for his help
lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-04.png|when we had installed my things and the
lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-05.png|boat began to move . The river was crowded
lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-06.png|with flocks of sailing boats which
lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-07.png|swirled round us like gulls and there
lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-08.png|were two locks to negotiate , but Max
lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-09.png|seemed to know exactly what to do
lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-10.png|and at the same time kept me supplied
lines/l07/l07-176/l07-176-01.png|him .  I used to play about in these things
lines/l07/l07-176/l07-176-02.png|when I was a kid . And then I acted as guide
lines/l07/l07-176/l07-176-04.png|going between terms at college .  It was
lines/l07/l07-176/l07-176-05.png|the first I had heard of it , but that 's
lines/l07/l07-176/l07-176-06.png|one of the things I like about Max .
lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-00.png|He has done so many things that there
lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-01.png|is always something new and exciting to
lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-03.png|said , meaning it . He pressed the tip of my
lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-04.png|nose with one finger .  That makes two of us . 
lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-05.png|It was about eight o'clock in the evening
lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-06.png|when we tied up almost exactly opposite
lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-07.png|Hardy's garden and went up on to the
lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-01.png|it stood a long way back from the water
lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-02.png|at the end of a velvety lawn flanked with
lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-03.png|flowering trees and shrubs . To the right of
lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-05.png|ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria ; it
lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-06.png|was built across a narrow backwater
lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-07.png|and there was a delicate iron staircase
lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-08.png|climbing the outer wall to a room above .
lines/l07/l07-190/l07-190-02.png|hand to stop him . The sun was no longer shining
lines/l07/l07-190/l07-190-03.png|and it was dark across there by the trees ,
lines/l07/l07-190/l07-190-04.png|but I thought I had seen something move .
lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-01.png|through him , and his mind seemed to
lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-02.png|melt away into emptiness . His bulging
lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-03.png|eyes caught the reclining form of Heather ,
lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-04.png|who was still repeating in sing-song :
lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-05.png| ... I will not give in ...  He stared at her
lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-07.png|of half words .
lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-00.png|He slapped himself in the face and
lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-01.png|cuffed the sides of his head . Then
lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-02.png|by degrees the rotating objects
lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-03.png|slowed , and coming into focus took
lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-04.png|the form of the furnishings in Dan
lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-05.png|Brown's living room . He stood up un-
lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-06.png|steadily and looked about the room ,
lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-07.png|trying to gather his wits . Outside the
lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-08.png|dusk was settling over Dow's Lake and
lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-10.png|silhouette , already a solid black .
lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-01.png|switched it on . Heather McNabb still lay
lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-02.png|on the couch , her body uncomfortably twisted
lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-03.png|and afflicted with occasional spasmodic jerks .
lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-04.png|He went to the kitchen for water and found
lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-05.png|Dan . Dan was lying on a long bench in the
lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-06.png|breakfast nook , his head bent upright
lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-07.png|against the wall .
lines/m01/m01-022/m01-022-00.png|His usually animated face was expressionless and looked flat ,
lines/m01/m01-022/m01-022-01.png|as though his nose had been pushed back and his eyes and cheeks
lines/m01/m01-022/m01-022-02.png|brought forward . He mouthed a low mutter , punctuated at intervals
lines/m01/m01-022/m01-022-03.png|with a few syllables of a crazy and incoherent jargon . As
lines/m01/m01-022/m01-022-04.png|Steve looked at him his mouth suddenly snapped shut ,
lines/m01/m01-022/m01-022-05.png|with jaws askew .
lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-00.png|There was utter imbecility in his blank face . Presently the
lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-01.png|muttering started again , and went on and on . Stunned and
lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-02.png|shaken , Steve drew a glass of water and went back to
lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-03.png|Heather . Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still
lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-04.png|trying to shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects .
lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-05.png|For several minutes they had been facing each other across
lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-06.png|a low table , like two old convalescents thoroughly bored with
lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-07.png|each other through forced association .
lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-00.png|Then something like a zest for living began to come back
lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-01.png|to Steve and he squeezed her hand . Her face took on
lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-02.png|enough animation to produce a wan smile . Dan's low mut-
lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-03.png|tering was just audible from the kitchen . And Steve
lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-04.png|could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions
lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-05.png|she was growing cold and numb with shock . She had seen
lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-06.png|Dan , or rather the physical relic of him - the empty
lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-07.png|shell of flesh and bone , devoid of intellect and
lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-00.png|And these had been his great qualities ,
lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-01.png|so attractive to her . The Base Station had
lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-02.png|gone before , discharging its narrow plane of
lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-03.png|4ementalating energy along the length of
lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-04.png|the Earth's imaginary longitudes , moving
lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-06.png|reversed progression . It had brought the
lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-07.png|First Stage in the Thetan pattern of conquest ,
lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-08.png|the empty-minded receptiveness that
lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-09.png|prepared the way for the Second Stage .
lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-00.png|He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-01.png|and came into the livingroom , where
lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-02.png|Heather and Steve stood aghast at
lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-03.png|his entrance . He came , almost falling
lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-04.png|forward in an ungainly shuffle , neck
lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-05.png|thrust out , arms dangling loosely .
lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-06.png|Then , abruptly , he drew himself up
lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-07.png|and walked on the very tips of
lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-08.png|his toes . He stretched his arms
lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-10.png|drawing-in great breaths that
lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-02.png|forward .  Isn't it a glorious thing ! Long awaited
lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-03.png|transcendent event , the exalted desire of all
lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-04.png|mankind through all ages ! The Kingdom of the
lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-05.png|Mind is at hand !  He turned beaming eyes
lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-06.png|upward and shook his head slowly from
lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-07.png|side to side .
lines/m01/m01-079/m01-079-00.png|A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
lines/m01/m01-079/m01-079-01.png|abroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
lines/m01/m01-079/m01-079-02.png|at an intersection for the light to change . At his
lines/m01/m01-079/m01-079-03.png|apartment he garaged his car and then stood
lines/m01/m01-079/m01-079-06.png|loses its beat in death .
lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-00.png|Deadly stillness , deadly portent !
lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-01.png|Steve awakened early and switched on
lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-03.png|The set lighted-up but gave only a low
lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-04.png|buzzing sound . He had just finished
lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-05.png|shaving when it came on , with a flat
lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-06.png|voice repeating :  This is BBC calling
lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-07.png|... this is BBC calling ... 
lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-00.png|After what seemed an undue period of repetition , the voice
lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-01.png|went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony
lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-02.png|in Sussex , in all its obscene details . Then the radio
lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-03.png|went dead again , and Steve had no stomach for
lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-04.png|breakfast . It was a beautiful day , as firsts-of-June
lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-05.png|should be . Steve got out the car and traversed the
lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-06.png|same empty streets as he had the night before ,
lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-07.png|to keep an appointment with Heather .
lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-00.png|Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-01.png|Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop . A
lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-02.png|flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-03.png|the War Memorial . There was a deep
lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-05.png|overtone that sang in his ears with an
lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-06.png|almost painful sharpness . He reversed and
lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-07.png|turned back on McKenzie Avenue .
lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-00.png|The Thetans must not see him ! He took another route
lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-01.png|to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on
lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-02.png|the way . Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at
lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-03.png|once ; but Steve insisted that they should first discuss
lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-04.png|their situation , as far as it could be assessed ,
lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-05.png|and to decide on what seemed to be the best
lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-06.png|way of meeting it .
lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-00.png| The Thetans ,  he said ,  are presumably here to
lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-01.png|take charge , as it were , of the minds of the
lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-02.png|people - who are probably falling all over them-
lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-03.png|selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-04.png|them out . Just what these orders will be , we don't
lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-05.png|know . Now , because of prior hypnosis we have es-
lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-06.png|caped Thetan subjugation . This time . But we no
lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-07.png|longer have any immunity .
lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-00.png|There can be little doubt that if the
lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-01.png|Thetans discover our mental independence
lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-02.png|they will promptly give us their hypnotic
lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-03.png|treatment . If we can avoid undue
lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-04.png|prominence , it may be that we can
lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-05.png|move about pretty freely without
lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-06.png|detection . If we can - well , then we
lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-08.png|interests . What those interests
lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-09.png|are , beyond personal security ,
lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-10.png|I haven't a clue ; but , who knows ,
lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-00.png| Now , to summarize what I think our
lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-01.png|course of action should be . First , to avoid the
lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-02.png|Thetans like the plague , for they must not
lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-03.png|find us out ! Second , to tread pretty warily
lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-04.png|among our own people , finding out just how
lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-05.png|much freedom we can take with safety .
lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-06.png|And third , to study these damned Thetans .
lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-07.png|We must learn all we can about
lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-08.png|them .
lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-00.png|There is just a hope that we may uncover
lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-01.png|some weakness , and find a way of fighting
lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-02.png|back at them .  Heather agreed , and suggested
lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-03.png|that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-04.png|ting how the Thetan machinations had been
lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-05.png|working out . It occurred to Steve that this may
lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-06.png|not have been entirely an objective suggestion
lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-07.png|on her part ; but he thought it a good idea
lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-00.png|So they proceeded to see if the coast
lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-01.png|was clear . The street was quiet and
lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-03.png|nor sound of flying saucers . So they
lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-04.png|ventured forth and made their way on
lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-05.png|foot to Dan's house . Dan came
lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-06.png|to the door at their ring but neglected
lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-07.png|to offer any greeting . He was deeply
lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-08.png|preoccupied , and it seemed that the
lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-09.png|ringing of a doorbell was to him
lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-10.png|a new and strange phenomenon .
lines/m01/m01-131/m01-131-00.png|When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action
lines/m01/m01-131/m01-131-01.png|gave the impression of having been thought out and
lines/m01/m01-131/m01-131-05.png|their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
lines/m01/m01-131/m01-131-06.png|down , up and down .
lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-00.png|His whole attitude was a mixture of
lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-01.png|impatience pending an awaited
lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-02.png|communication and of a vague
lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-03.png|perplexity respecting his surroundings
lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-04.png|and the purpose he was to serve .
lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-06.png|Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-07.png|at home . Steve switched on Dan's
lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-08.png|powerful , world-wide radio and systematically
lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-09.png|turned the tuning knob through all the

lines/m04/m04-012/m04-012-06.png|Morfydd Owen . Morfydd , who had until
lines/m04/m04-012/m04-012-07.png|recently been Ifor's typist , but was now

lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-01.png|Morfydd was saying .  Not the end of
lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-02.png|the world , is it ?   For me it is ,  Dai
lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-03.png|said wretchedly , wiping his hands on his
lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-04.png|overalls preparatory to a last embrace .  You
lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-05.png|will not be remembering a mere garage
lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-06.png|hand when you are lording it over
lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-07.png|the Mixed Infants of Llangrwl . 
lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-00.png| Silly boy ,  said Morfydd . Though she
lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-01.png|could not help wondering whether , now she
lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-02.png|had qualified as a schoolteacher , poor
lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-03.png|little Dai was quite the man for her .
lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-04.png|A nice boy of course . But perhaps in the
lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-05.png|new world she was entering there might
lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-06.png|be boys equally nice , and with far more
lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-07.png|to offer . The conductor rang his bell .
lines/m04/m04-030/m04-030-00.png| Good-bye , Dai ,  said Morfydd , smiling from the bottom step .
lines/m04/m04-030/m04-030-02.png|She was already up the bus steps , and the bus was away . And Morfydd Owen
lines/m04/m04-030/m04-030-03.png|waving , unkissed , from the window . And Dai , on the pavement , knowing in his
lines/m04/m04-030/m04-030-04.png|heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas .
lines/m04/m04-038/m04-038-00.png|So the bus set out for Llangrwl . But it never reached there ! Somewhere ,
lines/m04/m04-038/m04-038-01.png|on those fifteen miles of mountain roads , it disappeared from the earthly
lines/m04/m04-038/m04-038-02.png|scene . The first intimation that all was not well came when a
lines/m04/m04-038/m04-038-03.png|Mr. Isaiah Roberts , landlord of The Traveller's Joy , rang up the
lines/m04/m04-038/m04-038-04.png|Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their
lines/m04/m04-038/m04-038-05.png|damn bus .
lines/m04/m04-043/m04-043-03.png|reasonably .  Start running punctual and where are you ? People get
lines/m04/m04-061/m04-061-00.png| And what are you going to do about it ?  Tendentious , Mr. Roberts sounded .
lines/m04/m04-061/m04-061-04.png|and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller's Joy .
lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-00.png|The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to
lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-01.png|complete her mission .  Paled , did Dai . For the

lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-03.png|precious than jewels . Though Mofydd Owen
lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-04.png|was , as he feared , departed out of his life ,
lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-05.png|he still loved her dearly . Already , even
lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-06.png|as with trembling fingers he fastened his
lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-07.png|trouser clips , he was seeing her lying in
lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-08.png|some dreadful ravine , or beset by
lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-09.png|robbers , or being whisked off to Emergency
lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-10.png|Ward 10 .
lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-00.png|But even his imagination , luckily for him ,
lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-01.png|did not visualise the awful truth - that
lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-02.png|Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for
lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-05.png|Cadwallader when his child mind grasped
lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-06.png|the fact that the green earth was falling
lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-07.png|away at a rate of knots .
lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-00.png|Where indeed ? Megan Thomas spoke sharply
lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-01.png|to the conductor , demanding an explanation .
lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-02.png|But nonplussed , the conductor was . A
lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-03.png|good man , mind ; knew his job . But out of
lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-04.png|depth in this particular instance . Fingered
lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-05.png|his ticket-punch nervously . Peered out of
lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-06.png|the window . Went and consulted the driver .
lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-07.png| Where are we going ?  he echoed Cadwallader .
lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-09.png| But something very untoward has
lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-00.png|Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser , was the
lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-01.png|Rev. Edwards . Now he put down his paper ,
lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-02.png|folded it , and glanced idly out of the
lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-03.png|window . Looked again , eyes starting from
lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-04.png|his head .  God bless my immortal soul , 
lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-05.png|he cried .  Never mind your immortal
lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-06.png|soul ,  said Megan Thomas tartly .
lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-07.png| Here we are traversing the heavens at the
lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-08.png|very moment when we should be

lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-00.png|And no one doing the first thing about
lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-01.png|it .  Stung , the conductor was .  What you
lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-02.png|expect me to do ?  he inquired , bitter .
lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-03.png| Radio Flying Control at London Airport ,

lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-06.png| It 's all very well ,  commented
lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-07.png|Mr. Hayball from the back seat .
lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-00.png| But Eth and me wanted to be
lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-01.png|at the Youth Hostel before dark . 
lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-02.png|Morfydd Owen was silent . But she
lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-03.png|looked down at the fast-disappearing
lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-04.png|earth , and it seemed to her that she
lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-05.png|would never see her Dai again . And
lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-06.png|though half an hour ago she had
lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-07.png|regarded this possibility with
lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-08.png|fortitude , it now filled her with
lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-09.png|dismay . Quietly she began to
lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-10.png|weep ...
lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-00.png|Dai , meanwhile , was pedalling
lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-01.png|furiously on the road . Not a sign of
lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-02.png|the bus . He passed The Traveller's
lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-03.png|Joy . At last he caught up Mr. Roberts ,
lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-04.png|walking very dogged towards Llangrwl .
lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-05.png| Afternoon , Mr. Roberts ,  he called , polite ,
lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-06.png|as he shot past . His spirits were rising .
lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-07.png|He had seen no sign of an accident .
lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-08.png|Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken .
lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-09.png|He would find the bus safe and sound in
lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-10.png|Llangrwl , and his dear Morfydd quietly
lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-00.png|But disappointment awaited him . A
lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-01.png|restive queue of people in the bus station ,
lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-02.png|waiting to be transported to Dinas . And
lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-03.png|when he went to Morfydd's house , all
lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-04.png|he found was Morfydd's mam , working
lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-05.png|herself up proper ... Getting dark , now .
lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-06.png|The conductor switched on the lights .
lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-07.png|The beleaguered passengers peered out of
lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-08.png|the windows . Little to be seen , only a
lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-09.png|few lone stars , and the distant earth
lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-10.png|brooding in her shroud of mist .
lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-00.png|Megan Thomas sat tight-lipped , nursing

lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-02.png|conductor peered ahead into nothingness .
lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-03.png|On the back seat Stan Hayball embraced
lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-04.png|his Eth . Morfydd thought of Dai . The
lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-05.png|Rev. Edwards , standing at the front ,
lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-06.png|looked at his forlorn flock .  What
lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-08.png|he suggested hopefully .
lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-01.png|sank . If the Welsh found the situation
lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-02.png|too desperate for singing , then the
lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-03.png|situation , he realised , must be desperate
lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-04.png|indeed . But suddenly they were roused
lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-05.png|from their lethargy . Something was
lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-06.png|approaching , faster , faster , a tearing
lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-07.png|hurrying blur that was past and gone
lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-08.png|in a moment , followed by a great
lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-09.png|rush of sound . They waved frantically .
lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-00.png|But the jet aircraft was already miles away ,
lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-01.png|swinging down to the darkening earth .  It
lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-02.png|passed me at fifty thousand feet , sir . It was
lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-03.png|climbing steadily .  Group Captain Llewelyn Jones , Officer
lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-04.png|Commanding R.A.F. Station , Dinas , looked keenly at the
lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-05.png|Flying Officer who had burst so unceremoniously into his
lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-06.png|office .  And what did it look like , Broughtons ? Some
lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-07.png|sort of rocket ? 
lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-01.png| Well , actually , sir , it looked like - like a bus .
lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-02.png|A single-decker ,  he elaborated . Daggers , the
lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-03.png|Group Captain looked .  Broughtons ,  he said silkily .
lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-04.png| Didn't they teach you at Cranwell that buses are
lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-06.png|Buses crawl .  Very pale , Broughtons was . But
lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-01.png|Waving .  Like gimlets , the Station Commander's eyes .
lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-02.png| Did you see the indicator board ?   Yes , sir .   And
lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-03.png|what did it say ? Mystery Tour ?  Oh , very caustic , that
lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-04.png|Group Captain . But Broughtons stood his ground .  No ,
lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-06.png|back in his chair .  I see . So you met a bus at
lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-07.png|fifty thousand feet .
lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-00.png|All lit up . Full of people waving as you went past . 
lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-01.png|Suddenly he crouched forward .  Broughtons , if I thought
lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-03.png|I 'd have you court-martialled . But I know there
lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-04.png|isn't ,  he ended sadly .  I tried to read the
lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-05.png|registration number , sir . But it was getting dark . 
lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-06.png|He waited . But his commanding officer appeared to
lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-00.png|He saluted , and left the presence , very crestfallen ...
lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-01.png|Time passed . The bus climbed , and went quietly
lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-02.png|into orbit . Time passed . The Rev. Edwards' pulpit
lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-03.png|remained empty . And so did the arms of Dai
lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-04.png|Pugh . How could they be otherwise , when his
lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-05.png|beloved was circling the Poles at three-and-a-
lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-06.png|quarter-hour intervals , regular as clockwork ?
lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-07.png|Time passed . Everyone said ,  Pity about Megan
lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-09.png|it was a pity at all ; as , indeed , they didn't .
lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-01.png|Dinas Advertiser . But the London papers ignored
lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-02.png|the whole affair . Ifor Evans reported his loss
lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-04.png|a bus , is it . Very careless .  That was their
lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-05.png|attitude . Now if there 'd been a good old accident ,
lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-06.png|they could have measured up the road and
lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-07.png|taken an interest .
lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-00.png|But losing a bus ! People were always losing
lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-01.png|things . You 'd be surprised , they said . So it
lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-02.png|seemed , for a time , that the whole affair would
lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-03.png|be written off as one of those unexplained
lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-04.png|mysteries , like the Marie Celeste . Then things
lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-05.png|began to happen ... But what about the voyagers ?
lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-06.png|you will be asking .
lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-00.png|Well , the Rev. Edwards had taken command .  Our
lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-01.png|position ,  he said ,  is somewhat analogous to
lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-02.png|that of a castaway on a desert island . Now
lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-03.png|what does such a person do ? He signals
lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-04.png|his position by lighting bonfires or hoisting a
lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-05.png|flag on a palm tree . And he tries to ensure
lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-06.png|a supply of food . 
lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-00.png| Can't go lighting bonfires on this bus , 
lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-01.png|the conductor said firmly .  Contrary to the
lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-03.png|the minister .  No , we have another way of signalling
lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-04.png|our position . The driver must sound his horn
lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-05.png|continuously .  Gave him a look , the driver did .
lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-06.png| Where you think we are ?  he asked rudely .
lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-07.png| Dinas High Street ? 
lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-00.png| Do as I say , driver .  Very stern , the reverend
lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-01.png|gentleman was . So the driver peep-peeped as
lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-02.png|through empty space .  Thank you ,  the Rev.
lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-03.png|Edwards said courteously .  Secondly , we must
lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-04.png|pool and ration our supplies of food , if any . 
lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-06.png|a great basket .
lines/m04/m04-238/m04-238-00.png| Now , who has any food ?  he asked hopefully .
lines/m04/m04-238/m04-238-02.png| Mr. Price , I think you may be able to help us here , 
lines/m04/m04-238/m04-238-03.png|said the Rev. Edwards . Price shook his head .
lines/m04/m04-238/m04-238-04.png| Intended for Plas Newydd , this lot is . Paid for ,
lines/m04/m04-238/m04-238-05.png|too .  He folded his arms protectively over the basket .
lines/m04/m04-246/m04-246-00.png|Mutinous dog , thought the Rev. Edwards , who hadn't

lines/n01/n01-020/n01-020-00.png|For some reason the orderlies had forgotten

lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-01.png|make a direct comparison between the radar
lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-02.png|image and the ground itself . Ahead lay the
lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-03.png|Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the
lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-04.png|left , Milan . The directional angle of the
lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-05.png|scanner could be adjusted to cover any
lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-06.png|particular area within its range . Geoffrey
lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-08.png|ground immediately ahead .
lines/n01/n01-036/n01-036-00.png|He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the

lines/n01/n01-036/n01-036-02.png|on the clearest night limited angular vision . He glanced
lines/n01/n01-036/n01-036-03.png|at the speed recorder . It seemed almost incredible that
lines/n01/n01-036/n01-036-04.png|the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
lines/n01/n01-036/n01-036-05.png|was resting could really mean hundreds of knots .
lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-00.png|Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the
lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-01.png|pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft

lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-09.png|miles from their destination .
lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-00.png|They were nearing Modena . Geoffrey focused the radar scanner

lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-00.png|Geoffrey set himself to consider the
lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-01.png|movements of the Bentley . It had passed

lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-04.png|previous night . He worked out the distance
lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-05.png|on the presumption that its route had been
lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-06.png|through Florence and Rome and then
lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-07.png|across Italy via Foggia to Barletta .
lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-08.png|It came to just over six hundred
lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-09.png|miles .
lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-00.png|DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the

lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-03.png|speed to the Villa , it was quickly evident that
lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-04.png|the party was over . Piers came strolling out to
lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-05.png|meet the Deanes , and as soon as Guy had
lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-06.png|driven away , invited them casually to come to
lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-07.png|his flat for a drink .
lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-00.png|To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a
lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-01.png|vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent

lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-03.png|But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-04.png|was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-05.png|He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his
lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-06.png|own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of
lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-07.png|asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-08.png|to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
lines/n02/n02-009/n02-009-00.png| I caught him just as he was going to the

lines/n02/n02-016/n02-016-03.png|this side of Belleray .  Mrs. Deane made a suitable
lines/n02/n02-016/n02-016-04.png|comment , but Beryl said nothing . She was trying
lines/n02/n02-016/n02-016-05.png|to sort things out in her mind . That beneath his

lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-01.png|For the time being Beryl was content to let

lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-04.png|opportunity presented itself . He must
lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-05.png|learn that he could not treat her
lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-06.png|with injustice and contempt , ignoring
lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-07.png|her explanations as though he were

lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-09.png|ignorant child .
lines/n02/n02-037/n02-037-00.png|He gave her no chance of any private

lines/n02/n02-037/n02-037-03.png|them . But next morning she insisted
lines/n02/n02-037/n02-037-04.png|on his taking her out in the jeep -
lines/n02/n02-037/n02-037-05.png|to find , if possible , Hubert and his

lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-02.png|on to the second generation . One of these was that
lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-03.png|an officer should join a ship , on taking up a
lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-04.png|new appointment , at nine a.m. precisely , dressed

lines/n04/n04-048/n04-048-05.png|went in search of a drink . The lower bar was

lines/n04/n04-190/n04-190-01.png| more so than ever since I met you .

lines/n04/n04-202/n04-202-06.png|Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and

lines/n04/n04-209/n04-209-00.png|A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in

lines/n04/n04-209/n04-209-07.png|some sort .
lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-00.png|There had been many such breakfasts lately since the

lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-03.png|but she could see that it no longer came naturally .
lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-04.png|It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-05.png|to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine ,

lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-07.png|far between .
lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-00.png|This is the testing time for all . The affair blows up into

lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-02.png|must continue as before . During this period the Captain
lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-03.png|must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-04.png|if nothing unusual has happened . Harry Turton had
lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-05.png|written letters to the bereaved , had visited many in the

lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-00.png|With something of a start I remembered the

lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-02.png| Maybe you don't know about Appleton ,

lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-06.png|tried to surprise him .  Dead ?  he said .  Yes .
lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-07.png|Dead . Shuffled out of the deck . Blasted
lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-08.png|down with a shotgun outside the Palace

lines/n06/n06-111/n06-111-05.png|leading to the ridge . I followed . From the
lines/n06/n06-111/n06-111-06.png|top you could see something of the wild hill
lines/n06/n06-111/n06-111-07.png|country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing .
lines/n06/n06-119/n06-119-00.png|The air was fresh and clear and you

lines/n06/n06-119/n06-119-02.png|miles . The real high country of the Rockies
lines/n06/n06-119/n06-119-03.png|lifted up in the distance like a pale water-

lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-03.png|So we swung west , making slow going over
lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-04.png|rough country , sliding on shale , climbing down
lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-05.png|into draws , circling a big mesa by a
lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-06.png|four or five mile valley , sandy-floored . It
lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-07.png|got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-08.png|gratefully by a small creek where we watered
lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-09.png|the horses and drank enough to cure our

lines/p01/p01-155/p01-155-02.png|saw himself as a sulky , ugly , malformed , repressed
lines/p01/p01-155/p01-155-03.png|boy , then a young youth . He saw himself refusing
lines/p01/p01-155/p01-155-04.png|baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to .
lines/p01/p01-155/p01-155-06.png|on , his leaping mind flashed pictures of chi-
lines/p01/p01-155/p01-155-07.png|canery and corruption , the growth of the dea-
lines/p01/p01-155/p01-155-08.png|dly decadence and absorption in debase-

lines/p01/p01-168/p01-168-00.png|He didn't know what to make of it , but it

lines/p01/p01-168/p01-168-03.png|in London . Very strange his eyes looked . Mad ,
lines/p01/p01-168/p01-168-04.png|hunted eyes , as if the poor fellow had rocks in
lines/p01/p01-168/p01-168-05.png|his head , so the verger described afterwards .

lines/p01/p01-174/p01-174-00.png| Yes . I travelled down from London
lines/p01/p01-174/p01-174-01.png|as the dawn was breaking , and

lines/p02/p02-000/p02-000-03.png|together . The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the
lines/p02/p02-000/p02-000-05.png|hand and smiled .  I want to check up on the

lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-00.png|Gay went out to the waiting

lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-05.png|went quickly back to fetch them .

lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-09.png|pocket-book , with a sick feeling

lines/p02/p02-017/p02-017-02.png|miserable , shy , who had sat at the little
lines/p02/p02-017/p02-017-03.png|table for the first time a few days ago .
lines/p02/p02-017/p02-017-04.png|Gavin raised his glass to her and smiled
lines/p02/p02-017/p02-017-05.png|and Gay's heart turned over .  I 'd like
lines/p02/p02-017/p02-017-06.png|to do that .  Gavin drained his glass
lines/p02/p02-017/p02-017-07.png|and refilled it .
lines/p02/p02-022/p02-022-00.png| And then we 'll go for a stroll along the
lines/p02/p02-022/p02-022-01.png|beach . A moon like this mustn't be wasted . 
lines/p02/p02-022/p02-022-02.png|He gestured towards the bay where the full

lines/p02/p02-022/p02-022-04.png|laid his hand on hers . Gay smiled at him
lines/p02/p02-022/p02-022-07.png|only , yet remembering for a second the
lines/p02/p02-022/p02-022-08.png|kisses she had seen him giving Elaine .
lines/p02/p02-027/p02-027-00.png|All that was part of the past , she would put it behind her . She
lines/p02/p02-027/p02-027-01.png|would never be jealous again , would even take Larry's advice and

lines/p02/p02-027/p02-027-03.png|shoulder .  That 's a pretty girl !  Gay glanced behind her ,  Isn't she

lines/p02/p02-069/p02-069-01.png|to the bar . Doc and Lilyan were
lines/p02/p02-069/p02-069-02.png|sitting just inside having coffee .

lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-01.png|the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-02.png|had bought a drink and taken it outside .
lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-03.png|She looked round scanning the tables ,
lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-04.png|then caught her breath , a cold hand
lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-05.png|seeming to clutch her heart . Gavin was
lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-06.png|seated at a small table in a shadowy
lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-07.png|corner talking animatedly to Simone .
lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-08.png|As Gay watched he offered the girl a
lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-09.png|cigarette and lit it , his hands cupping
lines/p02/p02-081/p02-081-00.png|Gay stood irresolute for a moment , half
lines/p02/p02-081/p02-081-01.png|decided to go back and join Lilyan and
lines/p02/p02-081/p02-081-02.png|Doc , while she wanted to do no more than
lines/p02/p02-081/p02-081-03.png|run upstairs to her room , knowing that
lines/p02/p02-081/p02-081-04.png|Gavin although he had told her that he
lines/p02/p02-081/p02-081-05.png|loved her , was already flirting with a girl
lines/p02/p02-081/p02-081-06.png|that he had only met a few minutes before .
lines/p02/p02-081/p02-081-08.png|but she turned away , giving a little
lines/p02/p02-081/p02-081-09.png|gesture of hopelessness , knowing that her
lines/p02/p02-090/p02-090-00.png|The others were all dancing and
lines/p02/p02-090/p02-090-01.png|as Gay drew out a chair and sat
lines/p02/p02-090/p02-090-02.png|down Gavin , without a word , swept
lines/p02/p02-090/p02-090-03.png|Simone on to the floor .  It doesn't mean
lines/p02/p02-090/p02-090-04.png|anything ,  Gay told herself desperately ,
lines/p02/p02-090/p02-090-06.png|view and remembering the advice
lines/p02/p02-090/p02-090-07.png|that Larry had given her , while she
lines/p02/p02-090/p02-090-08.png|felt wretched beyond words .
lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-00.png|His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of
lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-01.png|taste but it was unkind beyond words . She fumbled
lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-02.png|with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-03.png|not wanting to smoke but needing some action
lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-04.png|to help her control her feelings .  Come and
lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-06.png|lifeline and Gay got up quickly , mana-
lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-07.png|ging a smile .
lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-00.png|As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin
lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-01.png|and Simone go through the doorway that led
lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-02.png|down to the beach . Gay closed her eyes for a
lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-03.png|moment in disgust . She was fully aware that Gavin
lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-04.png|would make love to the French girl on the sands ,
lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-05.png|and no doubt he would come back soon and
lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-06.png|after Simone had left expect her to accept his
lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-07.png|kisses on the way back to the hotel .
lines/p02/p02-109/p02-109-03.png|heart out over ?  Doc nodded towards the door .  You
lines/p02/p02-109/p02-109-04.png|may consider him a man , I would say he was a
lines/p02/p02-109/p02-109-06.png|weakly ,  you don't know Gavin .   I 've only met him
lines/p02/p02-109/p02-109-07.png|today but I think I can safely say that I know
lines/p02/p02-109/p02-109-08.png|him a great deal better than you do . 
lines/p02/p02-115/p02-115-00.png|Doc gave her hand a shake .  Wake up
lines/p02/p02-115/p02-115-01.png|Gay , and don't even contemplate throwing
lines/p02/p02-115/p02-115-02.png|yourself away on a chap like that . You 're a
lines/p02/p02-115/p02-115-03.png|fine girl , intelligent , and pretty , and I had
lines/p02/p02-115/p02-115-04.png|thought you were sensible too . Don't
lines/p02/p02-115/p02-115-05.png|make a fool of yourself over someone
lines/p02/p02-115/p02-115-06.png|who doesn't care two jots for your feelings .
lines/p02/p02-115/p02-115-07.png|If he behaves like this now what is your

lines/p02/p02-121/p02-121-00.png|Hell .  Doc answered for her .  Just Hell . Never able to
lines/p02/p02-121/p02-121-01.png|trust him out of your sight and having to put on
lines/p02/p02-127/p02-127-00.png|Gay nodded .  I know that you 're right Doc , I think
lines/p02/p02-127/p02-127-03.png|be the same , if you know what I mean .   You sound
lines/p02/p02-127/p02-127-05.png|I 'm glad you 're beginning to see that you 're wasting
lines/p02/p02-127/p02-127-06.png|your time on that chap .
lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-00.png|Now let him go and you won't have to wait

lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-02.png|along . If I was thirty years younger and weren't

lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-04.png|I 'd marry you myself .  Gay laughed , Doc was
lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-05.png|so kind and nice and she hoped that one
lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-06.png|day she would be able to see the situation
lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-07.png|as it obviously appeared to everyone else .
lines/p02/p02-135/p02-135-00.png|Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once

lines/p03/p03-027/p03-027-02.png|word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning , and
lines/p03/p03-027/p03-027-03.png|with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information ,
lines/p03/p03-027/p03-027-05.png|seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had
lines/p03/p03-027/p03-027-06.png|been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
lines/p03/p03-027/p03-027-07.png|Little Phelpham .
lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-00.png|Now Nigel had every right to go where he
lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-02.png|when she was not free ; this much they had
lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-03.png|conceded one to the other . They rarely
lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-04.png|found they were off duty together , and
lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-05.png|the situation would have been intolerable
lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-07.png|about their relationship . So when Nigel
lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-08.png|had told her about taking Luke's
lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-09.png|evening surgery she had said ,
lines/p03/p03-033/p03-033-01.png|he shrugged diffidently ,  I like the work . One gets plenty
lines/p03/p03-033/p03-033-02.png|of variety and it 's a change .  Nigel was the hospital's
lines/p03/p03-033/p03-033-03.png|Junior Medical Officer .  You won't be free about nine , I
lines/p03/p03-033/p03-033-04.png|suppose , to meet me for supper somewhere ?  she had

lines/p03/p03-040/p03-040-00.png| Hardly likely , my sweet . Luke's surgery goes on for
lines/p03/p03-040/p03-040-01.png|hours . If they get in before eight-thirty , even
lines/p03/p03-040/p03-040-02.png|though they 're standing on one another's toes ,
lines/p03/p03-040/p03-040-04.png|I 'll give you a ring , O.K. ?  O.K. ,  she had
lines/p03/p03-040/p03-040-05.png|replied readily . So how could Nigel have
lines/p03/p03-040/p03-040-06.png|been at the Load of Trouble roadhouse ,
lines/p03/p03-040/p03-040-08.png|very evening ?
lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-00.png| No ,  she told Phil Gubbins , a junior
lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-02.png|my lad .   It was Nigel's car , anyway .
lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-03.png|NUF 121 .   He probably loaned his car
lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-04.png|to somebody , Phil . He 's always doing that . 
lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-05.png|Young Gubbins shrugged .  I didn't see his
lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-06.png|face , Di , but it certainly looked like
lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-07.png|Nigel from the back . D.j. and all .
lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-08.png|Of course such as I couldn't afford
lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-09.png|to go into the Load of Trouble . 
lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-00.png| Neither can Nigel ,  smiled Diana .
lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-01.png| He 's saving up to get married . Remember ? 
lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-02.png| I remember ,  quipped the houseman ,
lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-03.png|meaning no offence ,  but does he ?
lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-04.png|That blonde was something .   Anybody
lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-05.png|I know ?  she smiled .  I think so .
lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-08.png| No ,  Di said immediately .  It isn't at
lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-09.png|all important . 
lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-00.png|But after that slight slip of the tongue on Nigel's part she had
lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-01.png|realised it was important enough for her to have remembered , and it
lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-02.png|was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and
lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-03.png|made her think there was an abyss immediately ahead .
lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-04.png| Nigel ,  she had besought him ,  you know that evening
lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-05.png|you took Luke Parson's surgery and there was a woman
lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-06.png|with a cyst on her ear ... ? 
lines/p03/p03-072/p03-072-00.png| 5Ye-es ?  he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the
lines/p03/p03-072/p03-072-01.png|mouth , an act of devotion he didn't over-indulge .
lines/p03/p03-072/p03-072-02.png| What about it , my sweet ?   Well ,  she laughed
lines/p03/p03-072/p03-072-03.png|suddenly in an upsurging of relief ,  that stupid
lines/p03/p03-072/p03-072-04.png|Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble .
lines/p03/p03-072/p03-072-05.png|With a blonde , too . Imagine !  Nigel was frowning . He
lines/p03/p03-072/p03-072-06.png|looked distinguished when he frowned ; boyishly
lines/p03/p03-080/p03-080-01.png|Though Diana knew the name of every
lines/p03/p03-080/p03-080-02.png|member of the staff , distinguished or not ,
lines/p03/p03-080/p03-080-03.png|Nigel often had to think hard to sort
lines/p03/p03-080/p03-080-05.png|he now demanded .  What was he
lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-00.png| Oh , he wasn't . His motor-bike had
lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-01.png|broken down outside and he noticed
lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-02.png|your car and then you dancing with
lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-03.png|this blonde .   Really ?  Nigel cocked
lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-04.png|one eyebrow .  Actually she was brunette
lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-05.png|at the roots and I had a redhead on
lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-06.png|the other arm . He would have told
lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-07.png|you this , too ?   No ,  she laughed .
lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-08.png| He didn't actually see you . Because
lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-09.png|it was your car I suppose he
lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-10.png|presumed it was you , all dressed up in
lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-00.png| My white or my black ?  Nigel enquired .
lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-01.png| Now I wonder which I wore at that
lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-02.png|particular surgery ?   You are a fool ,
lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-03.png|darling ,  Di said happily .  I shall take
lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-04.png|great pleasure in telling that young man
lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-05.png|exactly what you were doing that
lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-06.png|evening .   No , don't ,  he said , after
lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-07.png|kissing her again .  I rather like to have
lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-08.png|the housemen think of me as a
lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-09.png|two-timing Don Juan .
lines/p03/p03-103/p03-103-00.png|I 'm such a dull fellow , really .   Dull ?  She
lines/p03/p03-103/p03-103-01.png|couldn't believe it . Self-deprecation
lines/p03/p03-103/p03-103-02.png|was not one of Nigel's usual attributes .
lines/p03/p03-103/p03-103-03.png| You need your holiday , darling . I only
lines/p03/p03-103/p03-103-04.png|wish I could go with you !   Doctor
lines/p03/p03-103/p03-103-07.png|I suppose ?  she enquired archly .
lines/p03/p03-112/p03-112-00.png| No , it wouldn't !  he almost snapped ,
lines/p03/p03-112/p03-112-01.png|surprising her .  You sounded like some-
lines/p03/p03-112/p03-112-02.png|body else for a moment there . It doesn't
lines/p03/p03-112/p03-112-03.png|become you to behave like a - a tart , Di . 
lines/p03/p03-112/p03-112-04.png| Nigel - !  she gasped .  I didn't mean to
lines/p03/p03-112/p03-112-05.png|behave like anything of the kind . I
lines/p03/p03-112/p03-112-07.png|miserable enough my having to take my

lines/p03/p03-121/p03-121-04.png|come with me ; you hope I 'll miss you ; you
lines/p03/p03-121/p03-121-05.png|can't imagine the hospital without me for

lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-01.png|he admired her legs , which the male sex were inclined to
lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-02.png|regard first .  I would mind if you didn't  he told her
lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-03.png|grimly , and tugged her fiercely into his arms .  You 're
lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-04.png|right , pet . I do need this leave . I 'm bad-tempered and
lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-05.png|broody and going out with brash blondes . I don't deserve
lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-06.png|you . 
lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-01.png|make all the waiting worth while . When we 're
lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-02.png|married we won't have these explosions of emotion ,
lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-03.png|will we ?   No ,  he eyed her strangely .  I wish we
lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-04.png|were married , Di . Like a patient wishes his operation
lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-05.png|was over .  Again her laughter trilled .  Marriage
lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-06.png|isn't as bad as an operation , Nigel ! 
lines/p03/p03-151/p03-151-02.png|that particular problem isn't looming at
lines/p03/p03-151/p03-151-03.png|the moment , thank God !  Problem ... ?

lines/p03/p03-158/p03-158-01.png|your ring back .  She loosened the half-hoop of
lines/p03/p03-158/p03-158-02.png|diamonds on her left hand third finger and held it
lines/p03/p03-158/p03-158-03.png|out to him , still playfully . Without a glimmer
lines/p03/p03-158/p03-158-04.png|of amusement in his own eyes , however , he took
lines/p03/p03-158/p03-158-05.png|it , looking moodily beyond her .  Perhaps it 's as

lines/p03/p03-158/p03-158-07.png|told her .
lines/p03/p03-163/p03-163-04.png|about serious things like engagements . 
lines/p03/p03-163/p03-163-05.png| Don't be such a baby !  They were going

lines/p03/p03-173/p03-173-04.png|he told her , and suddenly seized her in an embrace
lines/p03/p03-173/p03-173-05.png|which really hurt .  Without your ring it 's just like
lines/p03/p03-173/p03-173-07.png|and kissed her again , somewhat startled to
lines/p03/p03-181/p03-181-01.png|what you 'd get ,  she flashed at him , and
lines/p03/p03-181/p03-181-02.png|so had left him , on her dignity and not
lines/p03/p03-181/p03-181-03.png|seeing the look of admiration and revelation
lines/p03/p03-181/p03-181-04.png|which had followed her slim young figure
lines/p03/p03-181/p03-181-07.png|then regarded the ring which he retrieved
lines/p03/p03-181/p03-181-09.png|with some bitterness .
lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-00.png|Thus had they parted the previous evening and now

lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-02.png|alone . Of course one couldn't say for certain when a
lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-03.png|doctor would be free during the day ; tea was served
lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-04.png|from four until five-thirty in the residents' common-
